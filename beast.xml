What it does
------------

This runs BEAST for an Argo Navis analysis.
The inline help should clarify what is required for this tool.
The output files produced are an "Argo BEAST logfile", suitable for running through Tracer to check for mixing, and an
"Argo BEAST treefile" for passing along to PACT.
If you have run BEAST repeatedly on some data using the ``-resume`` functionality (by passing "Last logfile" and "Last treefile")
these files may become very large, and slow down Tracer and/or PACT significantly.
To deal with this you can use the Posterior Subset Tool to reduce the size of these files.

If you'd like to customize more fine tuned settings of the BEAST MCMC (models, priors, etc), you can do so by specifying a custom BEAST file template.
The default template is XXX here and can be used as a starting point.
