What it does
------------

This runs PACT for an Argo Navis analysis.
PACT (Posterior Analysis of Coalescent Trees), as the name suggests, is a tool for analyzing the tree file output of an Argo
Navis BEAST run.
It is an impressive tool, with many powerful analytic features, but we'll only focus on a core subset in this wrapper of the tool.

The key features of PACT that make it so powerful are its vast range of statistics and metrics which can be computed, coupled with
it's ability to restrict these metrics to a subset of the tree ancestry, both in time and in tree tips.
These features make it possible to ask very pointed questions out of a complicated data set.
For instance, imagine you have virus sequences from a number of host species;
You might want to find out what the ancestry looks like of the viruses in species A.
In particular, you might want to know what population(s) the virus in species A was in just before ending there.
With PACT, you can simply subset to the viruses in species A to invetigate this, and look at any number of statistics for them.

While PACT has many different analyses and statistics you can perform, here we focus on a select few.
We look at:

* **Skyline proportions**: These look at the ancestral proportions associated with each deme as we look back towards the root.
* **Migrate rates**: These are estimates with bounds of the rate of migration between each pair of demes.
* **Maximum likelyhood reconstruction**: The most likley tree and acestral demestate history in the posterior.
* **Other miscelaneous stats**: TMCA, etc.

We also let you restrict the tree to any tip set or temporal range you like.

If you would like to run other analyses, you can take a look at the `PACT documentation`_.
While this tool doesn't support plotting functionality for more advanced analyses, you can place your own PACT file in this tool,
get the results in the output zip file and do what you like with them.

Output files
------------

This tool outputs two files:

* **PACT figures**: A collection of figures representing the results for these analyses.
* **All files**: A collection of any other files output by PACT.
